**Homework Assignment 2: Encapsulation**

Create a Java class representing a bank account with the following attributes:

- Account holder's name (private)
- Account number (private)
- Current balance (private)

Provide appropriate setter and getter methods to encapsulate these attributes. Implement the following methods in the class:

1. `deposit(double amount)`: Add the specified amount to the current balance.
2. `withdraw(double amount)`: Deduct the specified amount from the current balance if sufficient funds are available.

Write a separate Java program that demonstrates the usage of the bank account class. Create an instance of the bank account, deposit and withdraw funds, and display the final balance.

**Homework Assignment 2: Method Overloading**

Create a Java class named "Calculator" with methods for performing basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use method overloading to provide multiple versions of each operation to handle different data types (e.g., int, double).

The class should have the following methods:

1. `add(int a, int b)`: Returns the sum of two integers.
2. `add(double a, double b)`: Returns the sum of two doubles.
3. `subtract(int a, int b)`: Returns the result of subtracting b from a (a - b).
4. `subtract(double a, double b)`: Returns the result of subtracting b from a (a - b).
5. `multiply(int a, int b)`: Returns the product of two integers.
6. `multiply(double a, double b)`: Returns the product of two doubles.
7. `divide(int a, int b)`: Returns the result of dividing a by b (a / b).
8. `divide(double a, double b)`: Returns the result of dividing a by b (a / b).

Create a Java program to demonstrate the usage of the "Calculator" class by performing various mathematical operations with different data types.

**Additional Challenge:**
Extend the Calculator class to handle more complex mathematical operations and demonstrate method overloading with a variety of parameter types.

These assignments will help students practice encapsulation and method overloading while working on real-world scenarios.
