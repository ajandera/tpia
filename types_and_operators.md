# Java Basic Concepts. Types, Expressions, Operators

Java is a widely used and versatile programming language known for its portability, reliability, and ease of use. To become proficient in Java, it is essential to grasp the basic concepts that underlie the language's functionality.

**Data Types:**

Java is a statically typed language, which means that variables must have a declared data type before they can be used. There are two main categories of data types in Java: primitive data types and reference data types.

*Primitive Data Types:*
1. **int:** Represents integer values.
2. **double:** Represents floating-point numbers.
3. **char:** Stores a single character.
4. **boolean:** Represents a true or false value.
5. **byte, short, long, float:** Additional numeric data types with different storage sizes and precision.

*Reference Data Types:*
1. **Class:** Represents user-defined data types.
2. **String:** Stores sequences of characters.
3. **Arrays:** Contain collections of elements of the same data type.

**Variables:**

Variables are used to store data in Java. They must be declared with a data type and an identifier, which is the variable name. For example:

```java
int age = 30;
double price = 19.99;
String name = "John";
```

**Expressions:**

An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and constants that represents a single value. Java supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.

*Arithmetic Operators:*
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

*Relational Operators:*
- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

*Logical Operators:*
- Logical AND (&&)
- Logical OR (||)
- Logical NOT (!)

**Operators:**

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. They are essential for building expressions and controlling the flow of your program. In addition to arithmetic, relational, and logical operators, Java also supports:

*Assignment Operators:*
- Assignment (=)
- Addition assignment (+=)
- Subtraction assignment (-=)
- Multiplication assignment (*=)
- Division assignment (/=)

*Increment and Decrement Operators:*
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)

*Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator):*
- It is used for conditional expressions and has the form: (condition) ? expression1 : expression2.

*Bitwise Operators:*
- Bitwise AND (&)
- Bitwise OR (|)
- Bitwise XOR (^)
- Bitwise NOT (~)
- Left shift (<<)
- Right shift (>>)
- Unsigned right shift (>>>)

**In conclusion, Java's basic concepts, including data types, expressions, and operators, form the foundation of this powerful programming language. Understanding how to declare variables, create expressions, and use various operators is crucial for writing Java programs. Java's versatility and popularity make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers. By mastering these fundamental concepts, you can start building more complex and sophisticated Java applications."
