# Number guessing game

**Title:** Number Guessing Game

**Objective:** To create a simple text-based number guessing game using Java.

**Description:**

In this project, you will develop a text-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the player's task is to guess that number within the given range. The game will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it will continue until the player correctly guesses the number.

**Requirements:**

1. The game should generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100).

2. The player should be prompted to guess the number.

3. After each guess, the game should provide feedback:
    - If the guess is too high, display "Try a lower number."
    - If the guess is too low, display "Try a higher number."
    - If the guess is correct, display "Congratulations! You guessed the number in [number of tries] tries."

4. The game should continue until the player correctly guesses the number.

5. You should use the `Scanner` class to read user input and the `Random` class to generate random numbers.

**Bonus Tasks (Optional):**

1. Allow the player to choose the range of numbers for the game (e.g., between 1 and 100 or 1 and 1000).

2. Implement error handling for non-integer inputs (Input validation).

3. Provide an option for the player to play again after guessing the number.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file in folder homework1 with your name.

2. Create a Java class for the Number Guessing Game.

3. Implement the game logic following the requirements listed above.

4. Test your game to ensure that it functions as expected.

5. Optionally, add the bonus tasks to enhance your game.

**Submission:**

Commit and push the file to the github repository.
